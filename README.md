# reservationsApp
## Description
We have designed an application created specifically for an Italian fine-dining restaurant that allows users to view the restaurantâ€™s menu, make a reservation and view/leave reviews
The motivation behind the creation of this app is to have one app that includes everything one restaurant would need from their online site


## Installation
The npms included in this project are connect-session-sequelize, dotenv, express, express-handlebars, express-session, moment, moment-countdown, mysql2, and sequelize. 

They can be insalled using the command: 

``npm i``


## User story
As a USER 
GIVEN that I want to eat at this specific restaurant
WHEN I view the website
THEN I am presented with a homepage which includes the menu and an option to login 
WHEN I login/create a login
THEN I am presented with the option to leave a Review, Reservation or view all Reservations or Reviews
WHEN I leave a new reservation/review
THEN said reservation/review is added to the list of reservations/reviews


## Future Dev
-Launch Reviews page with full capability 
-Add an additional technology or package
-Use additional authentication for an employee login so that only employees can see the list of reservations.
-Use an API with various menu items and have a new one be displayed on the menu daily 
-Style and rearrange overall layout
